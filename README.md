# My Sorting Table
Simple class to perform the table sort: was created specifically to compensate for the fact that - sometimes - sorting datatables cannot be applied.<br>
The other usefulness is that it's a single file. It does not depend on any other file (css, javascript, etc.)

Add the .toSort class to the th to be sorted. <br>
Add the .defaultSort class to the th to be sorted immediately upon loading the table.
